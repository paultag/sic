HACKING ON [sic]
================

Hey there! Welcome!


QUICKSTART
----------

Let's make sure the submodules are good (or clone with `--recursive`)

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

We need some stuff on the host:

```
sudo apt-get install \
    python3 \
    virtualenvwrapper \
    node-less \
    coffeescript \
    npm \
    nodejs-legacy
```

Now, let's set up our Python setup:

```
make -C scripts
cd third-party/jquery
npm run build
cd -

mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) sic
workon sic

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Let's first set a secret key - the value of this isn't super important
# during development. Pick something secure for production. Lots of entropy.
export SECRET_KEY=$(uuid)
# And, now, let's set Django to Debug mode for development
export DJANGO_DEBUG=True
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loadlicense AGPLv3 LICENSE.AGPL
./manage.py runserver
```

And hack!
